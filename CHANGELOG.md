# Changelog

All notable changes to the Forge DevOps deployment will be documented
in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to CalVer (`YYYY.MM.PATCH`).

## [Unreleased]

## [2026.04.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Docker Compose stack: postgres, redis, OPA, OTel Collector,
  forge-web, forge-task, forge-frontend, nginx
- Single-VM Vagrantfile for evaluation deployments
- Backup/restore scripts (`scripts/backup.sh`, `scripts/restore.sh`)
- Health-check scripts (`healthcheck-web.sh`, `healthcheck-task.sh`)
- Nginx reverse proxy config with SSL/Let's Encrypt support
- Assistant nginx proxy (with `resolver` so the service stays optional)
- Receptor mesh configuration and init scripts
- `.env.example` template for environment configuration
- Jenkinsfile with standalone, assistant, and integration test stages

### Changed
- forge-task now runs `privileged: true` so podman-in-docker works for
  Execution Environments
- Receptor port surfaced in `.env.example` for inter-node mesh

### Fixed
- Init script + Receptor config now usable on a fresh deploy
  (no manual editing required)
- podman-in-docker path now works end-to-end inside the task container
