# 10 — Contributing Guide

Git workflow, commit conventions, coding standards, and the PR process.

---

## Rules

1. **All development and testing inside the Vagrant VM** — never install dependencies on the host
2. **Every change must be understood** — if you can't explain why, don't commit it
3. **Author of all commits is Krstan Vjestica** — never attribute tools as authors
4. **Review the diff before committing** — always

---

## Git Workflow

### Branch naming

```
feature/dynamic-surveys        # New feature
fix/job-stuck-pending          # Bug fix
refactor/split-serializers     # Refactoring
docs/wiki-task-engine          # Documentation
test/inventory-api-tests       # Tests
chore/update-dependencies      # Maintenance
```

### Standard flow

```bash
# 1. Create branch from devel
git checkout devel
git pull origin devel
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes, test, commit
vagrant rsync
vagrant ssh -c "cd /awx_devel && forge-test"
git add forge/main/models/my_model.py
git commit -m "feat(models): add Policy model for governance"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

### Updating the branch

```bash
git checkout devel && git pull origin devel
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase devel
```

## Commit Conventions

### Format

```
type(scope): short description
```

### Types

| Type | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(api): add /policies/ endpoint` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(tasks): prevent job stuck in pending` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | `refactor(serializers): split into modules` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs(wiki): add task engine documentation` |
| `test` | Tests | `test(api): add inventory CRUD tests` |
| `chore` | Maintenance | `chore(deps): update Django to 4.2.18` |

### Scopes

`models`, `api`, `tasks`, `ui`, `auth`, `rbac`, `deploy`, `ci`, `deps`

### Rules

- First line **under 72 characters**
- **Imperative mood:** "add feature" not "added feature"
- **No period** at the end of the first line
- **Never AI attribution** in commit messages

---

## Coding Standards

### Python

- Max line length: **160 characters** (configured in pyproject.toml)
- Imports: standard library → third party → local (separated by blank lines)
- Descriptive variable names: `running_jobs` not `x`
- f-strings for formatting: `f"Job {job.id} failed"`
- Never bare `except:` — always a specific exception type

### TypeScript/React

- Functional components with hooks (no class components)
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- TanStack Query for data fetching (not useEffect + fetch)
- `cn()` for conditional Tailwind classes
- Semantic colors (`bg-background`) not hardcoded (`bg-white`)
- Path alias `@/` instead of relative `../../..`

### Linting (run before every commit)

```bash
flake8 forge/ --count --statistics
cd forge/ui_next && npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before creating a PR

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventions
- [ ] Branch is rebased on latest `devel`
- [ ] Changes are minimal and focused

### PR guidelines

- **Keep PRs small** — ideally under 500 lines. Large PRs are harder to review.
- **One concern per PR** — don't mix a bug fix with refactoring.
- **Include tests** — new features need tests, bug fixes need a regression test.
- **Target `devel` branch** — all PRs merge into `devel`.

### Review Checklist

**For the author:**
- [ ] Reviewed my own diff before requesting review
- [ ] No debug code, console.log, or print statements
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or URLs
- [ ] Error handling is adequate
- [ ] New code has tests

**For the reviewer:**
- [ ] Code does what the PR description says
- [ ] Security: no SQL injection, XSS, credential exposure
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (empty lists, null, concurrent access)
- [ ] Follows existing patterns in the codebase
- [ ] Will this be easy to maintain in 6 months?

4. View in `forge/api/views/`
5. URL module in `forge/api/urls/` → register in `urls.py`
6. Access class in `forge/main/access.py`
7. Tests

### Add a new frontend page

1. TypeScript types in `src/api/types.ts`
2. API hooks in `src/api/hooks/`
3. Page in `src/pages/`
4. Route in `src/App.tsx`
5. Navigation in `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
6. Tests

### Add a management command
